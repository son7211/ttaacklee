## ENTRYPOINT
#### ENTRYPOINT has two forms:

 - `ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form, preferred)`
 - `ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2 (shell form)`

An `ENTRYPOINT` allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable.

For example, the following will start nginx with its default content, listening on port 80:
```
docker run -i -t --rm -p 80:80 nginx
```

Command line arguments to `docker run <image>` will be appended after all elements in an exec form `ENTRYPOINT`, and will override all elements specified using `CMD`. This allows arguments to be passed to the entry point, i.e., `docker run <image> -d` will pass the `-d` argument to the entry point. You can override the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction using the `docker run --entrypoint` flag.

The _shell_ form prevents any `CMD` or `run` command line arguments from being used, but has the disadvantage that your `ENTRYPOINT` will be started as a subcommand of `/bin/sh -c`, which does not pass signals. This means that the executable will not be the container’s `PID 1` - and will not receive Unix signals - so your executable will not receive a `SIGTERM` from `docker stop <container>`.

Only the last `ENTRYPOINT` instruction in the `Dockerfile` will have an effect.

#### Exec form ENTRYPOINT example
You can use the exec form of `ENTRYPOINT` to set fairly stable default commands and arguments and then use either form of `CMD` to set additional defaults that are more likely to be changed.
```
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["top", "-b"]
CMD ["-c"]
```
When you run the container, you can see that `top` is the only process:
```
$ docker run -it --rm --name test  top -H
top - 08:25:00 up  7:27,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
Threads:   1 total,   1 running,   0 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
%Cpu(s):  0.1 us,  0.1 sy,  0.0 ni, 99.7 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
KiB Mem:   2056668 total,  1616832 used,   439836 free,    99352 buffers
KiB Swap:  1441840 total,        0 used,  1441840 free.  1324440 cached Mem

  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
    1 root      20   0   19744   2336   2080 R  0.0  0.1   0:00.04 top

```

To examine the result further, you can use `docker exec`:
```
$ docker exec -it test ps aux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  2.6  0.1  19752  2352 ?        Ss+  08:24   0:00 top -b -H
root         7  0.0  0.1  15572  2164 ?        R+   08:25   0:00 ps aux
```

And you can gracefully request `top` to shut down using `docker stop test`.

The following `Dockerfile` shows using the `ENTRYPOINT` to run Apache in the foreground (i.e., as `PID 1`):
```
FROM debian:stable
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --force-yes apache2
EXPOSE 80 443
VOLUME ["/var/www", "/var/log/apache2", "/etc/apache2"]
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
```

If you need to write a starter script for a single executable, you can ensure that the final executable receives the Unix signals by using `exec` and `gosu` commands:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

if [ "$1" = 'postgres' ]; then
    chown -R postgres "$PGDATA"

    if [ -z "$(ls -A "$PGDATA")" ]; then
        gosu postgres initdb
    fi

    exec gosu postgres "$@"
fi

exec "$@"
```
Lastly, if you need to do some extra cleanup (or communicate with other containers) on shutdown, or are co-ordinating more than one executable, you may need to ensure that the `ENTRYPOINT` script receives the Unix signals, passes them on, and then does some more work:
```
#!/bin/sh
# Note: I've written this using sh so it works in the busybox container too

# USE the trap if you need to also do manual cleanup after the service is stopped,
#     or need to start multiple services in the one container
trap "echo TRAPed signal" HUP INT QUIT TERM

# start service in background here
/usr/sbin/apachectl start

echo "[hit enter key to exit] or run 'docker stop <container>'"
read

# stop service and clean up here
echo "stopping apache"
/usr/sbin/apachectl stop

echo "exited $0"
```
If you run this image with `docker run -it --rm -p 80:80 --name test apache`, you can then examine the container’s processes with `docker exec`, or `docker top`, and then ask the script to stop Apache:
```
$ docker exec -it test ps aux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  0.1  0.0   4448   692 ?        Ss+  00:42   0:00 /bin/sh /run.sh 123 cmd cmd2

www-data    21  0.2  0.2 360468  6000 ?        Sl   00:42   0:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
root        81  0.0  0.1  15572  2140 ?        R+   00:44   0:00 ps aux
$ docker top test
PID                 USER                COMMAND
10035               root                {run.sh} /bin/sh /run.sh 123 cmd cmd2
10054               root                /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
10055               33                  /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
10056               33                  /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
$ /usr/bin/time docker stop test
test
real	0m 0.27s
user	0m 0.03s
sys	0m 0.03s
```

Note: you can override the `ENTRYPOINT` setting using `--entrypoint`, but this can only set the binary to exec (no `sh -c` will be used).

Note: The exec form is parsed as a JSON array, which means that you must use double-quotes (“) around words not single-quotes (‘).

Note: Unlike the shell form, the exec form does not invoke a command shell. This means that normal shell processing does not happen. For example, `ENTRYPOINT [ "echo", "$HOME" ]` will not do variable substitution on $HOME. If you want shell processing then either use the shell form or execute a shell directly, for example: `ENTRYPOINT [ "sh", "-c", "echo $HOME" ]`. When using the exec form and executing a shell directly, as in the case for the shell form, it is the shell that is doing the environment variable expansion, not docker.

#### Shell form ENTRYPOINT example
You can specify a plain string for the `ENTRYPOINT` and it will execute in `/bin/sh -c`. This form will use shell processing to substitute shell environment variables, and will ignore any `CMD` or `docker run` command line arguments. To ensure that `docker stop` will signal any long running `ENTRYPOINT` executable correctly, you need to remember to start it with `exec`:
```
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT exec top -b
```

When you run this image, you’ll see the single `PID 1` process:
```
$ docker run -it --rm --name test top
Mem: 1704520K used, 352148K free, 0K shrd, 0K buff, 140368121167873K cached
CPU:   5% usr   0% sys   0% nic  94% idle   0% io   0% irq   0% sirq
Load average: 0.08 0.03 0.05 2/98 6
  PID  PPID USER     STAT   VSZ %VSZ %CPU COMMAND
    1     0 root     R     3164   0%   0% top -b
```

Which will exit cleanly on `docker stop`:
```
$ /usr/bin/time docker stop test
test
real	0m 0.20s
user	0m 0.02s
sys	0m 0.04s
```
If you forget to add `exec` to the beginning of your `ENTRYPOINT`:
```
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT top -b
CMD --ignored-param1
```

You can then run it (giving it a name for the next step):
```
$ docker run -it --name test top --ignored-param2
Mem: 1704184K used, 352484K free, 0K shrd, 0K buff, 140621524238337K cached
CPU:   9% usr   2% sys   0% nic  88% idle   0% io   0% irq   0% sirq
Load average: 0.01 0.02 0.05 2/101 7
  PID  PPID USER     STAT   VSZ %VSZ %CPU COMMAND
    1     0 root     S     3168   0%   0% /bin/sh -c top -b cmd cmd2
    7     1 root     R     3164   0%   0% top -b
```

You can see from the output of `top` that the specified `ENTRYPOINT` is not `PID 1`.

If you then `run docker stop test`, the container will not exit cleanly - the `stop` command will be forced to send a `SIGKILL` after the timeout:
```
$ docker exec -it test ps aux
PID   USER     COMMAND
    1 root     /bin/sh -c top -b cmd cmd2
    7 root     top -b
    8 root     ps aux
$ /usr/bin/time docker stop test
test
real	0m 10.19s
user	0m 0.04s
sys	0m 0.03s
```

#### Understand how CMD and ENTRYPOINT interact
Both `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions define what command gets executed when running a container. There are few rules that describe their co-operation.

 1. Dockerfile should specify at least one of `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` commands.

 2. `ENTRYPOINT` should be defined when using the container as an executable.

 3. `CMD` should be used as a way of defining default arguments for an `ENTRYPOINT` command or for executing an ad-hoc command in a container.

 4. `CMD` will be overridden when running the container with alternative arguments.

The table below shows what command is executed for different `ENTRYPOINT / CMD` combinations:

||No ENTRYPOINT	ENTRYPOINT|exec_entry p1_entry|	ENTRYPOINT [“exec_entry”, “p1_entry”]|
--|--|--|--
|No CMD|	error, not allowed	| /bin/sh -c exec_entry p1_entry|exec_entry p1_entry
|CMD [“exec_cmd”, “p1_cmd”] |	exec_cmd p1_cmd	|/bin/sh -c exec_entry p1_entry |	exec_entry p1_entry exec_cmd p1_cmd
|CMD [“p1_cmd”, “p2_cmd”]	| p1_cmd p2_cmd	| /bin/sh -c exec_entry p1_entry	| exec_entry p1_entry p1_cmd p2_cmd
CMD exec_cmd p1_cmd |	/bin/sh -c exec_cmd p1_cmd |/bin/sh -c exec_entry p1_entry	| exec_entry p1_entry /bin/sh -c exec_cmd p1_cmd

Note: If `CMD` is defined from the base image, setting `ENTRYPOINT` will reset `CMD` to an empty value. In this scenario, `CMD` must be defined in the current image to have a value.
